                <h2>Enjoy a Piece of Writing from my Collection:</h2>
                <p>If you look up how to handle rejection you may find the following :</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Acknowledge your emotions (Nope I was ashamed of them)</li>
                    <li>Viewing rejection as you pushing the limits (Nope viewed it as a sign that there was something wrong with me)</li>
                    <li>Treat yourself with compassion (Nope I loathed myself and was angry at my feelings, angry at you, angry at the world)</li>
                    <li>Refusing to let rejection define you (Nope I let it define me)</li>
                    <li>Learn from the rejection (Nope I just learned to not want to experience rejection again...I ran)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>When you ended things I felt it all:</p>
                <p class="text-bold-italic">Hurt</p>
                <p class="text-bold-italic">Anger</p>
                <p class="text-bold-italic">Pain & Sadness</p>
                <p class="text-bold-italic">Loneliness</p>
                <p class="text-bold-italic">Shame and Self Loathing</p>
                <p>It took me weeks to finally get over you, no months actually, to move on. In this I realized I myself was not able to handle rejection. Why was this rejection so different from any other? It was the first time I ever felt such a deep connection with someone. The first time I had many things in common with someone I wanted to love. The first time I wanted to cry just being wrapped up in your arms. The first time I had a first date that lasted for 5 hours. I exposed my true authentic self on our first date. I felt accepted by you. </p>
                <p>You helped me learn what I want in a partner and also showed me how much more growing I have to do before I meet that partner. </p>
                <p class="align-right">When you ended things I was left <span class="text-bold-italic">hurt</span></p>
                <p>Hurt like being stripped bare naked with all truth to be spoken, only for her to look you up and down, taking it all in, just to walk away. Hurting over the sex that made me feel connected to you like we our bodies were placed in the sky to forever be entwined, even when the Earth is gone we still stayed tangled up in the night sky. Hurt because you reciprocated my passion and I wanted to experience it together like I’ve never done before. </p>
                <p class="align-right">When I stopped hurting it was replaced by <span class="text-bold-italic">anger</span></p>
                <p>I became angry at you for making the decision that you did. I would see you at the gym and get angry, and use that anger and put it into my workout, to push myself harder. I didn’t want to be angry at you, I wanted to do the opposite. On days when I did see you at the gym I would be disappointed. Disappointed that I couldn’t feel angry to give me the edge I was seeking. Angry at myself for thinking about you, angry for wanting you. After a week of being angry I was mentally exhausted, tired, wanting this all to be over.</p>
                <p class="align-right">When the anger stopped then came the <span class="text-bold-italic">pain & sadness</span></p>
                <p>Anytime I consumed something about love it just made me sad as all it made me do was think of you. Then the memories of our time came surging back, I was assaulted by the happiness, and the sensual pleasure you brought. It all came back throwing me into agonizing pain. These vivid images of the pure ecstasy you gave me, sent me spiraling down the memory hole that contained nothing but memory upon memory of you. I tried to crawl my way out of it, but my struggle against the onslaught was futile. I fell deeper and deeper into my two friends, pain and sadness. As the feelings left me I was but hollow and empty inside, it was almost as if I was but a lifeless body waiting for myself to decompose. You filled me with happiness, and made off with all of me.</p>
                <p class="align-right">When the pain & sadness subsided I was overcome with <p class="text-bold-italic">loneliness</p></p>
                <p>I was so alone that I wanted to wallow in it, I wanted to become the loneliness. I began to idealize and romanticize the idea of going vagabonding. Stripping my identity and starting anew where no one knows me. Losing everything, just so I can lose my emotions. I didn’t want to feel anything anymore. I wanted to run. I was afraid of opening myself up to anyone else again. After these thoughts passed I was presented with more loneliness, my solution to combat it was to find a warm body to replace what I had lost. As I laid bare with the bare female body, all it did was make me think of you. Her smell was unlike yours and it was off putting, not so off putting to where I was repulsed with the act of laying with this body, but off putting enough to where it made me think of how much I miss your smell, and how much I loved it. Fucking the body made me miss the sex with you, I would not use such a word as fucking to describe our sex, ours was something of meaning to I. It was like the exquisiteness of classical music, it was on the level of comparison of that of choir music, it was beyond the words I use to describe it, it was fucking crack, but more so the purest of crack, it was Divine.</p>
                <p class="align-right">When the loneliness vacated the scene I was <span class="text-bold-italic">shameful & self-loathing</span></p>
                <p>I hated the way you leaving made me feel. I was ashamed that I felt all of this and for so long over a relationship that was only a week long. I never cried but maybe that is what I needed all along. To get super fucked up, and cry. No. I didn’t want to give you that. Instead I endured all of the feelings and put myself down for feeling them. I wanted to be a weapon, someone who isn’t phased by things of this nature, someone who has mastery over their emotions, someone who has a purpose and goals so great that a woman would not deter one from them. Yet when you were here you did the exact opposite of this, you consumed my thinking, and my time, I wanted you like nothing else.</p>
                <p class="text-bold-italic">Homeostasis & Beauty</p>
                <p>I am back to being me. Back to needing to work on my own problems rather than my problem of getting over you. Back to trying to be happier and not pessimistic. Back to finding my momentum. Back to my reality. Back to a life that doesn’t include you and that’s okay. Back to getting better. Back to becoming the type of person I want to attract. Back to becoming happy with myself with or without the partner that is to be the finale. Back to shaping my life. Back to finding happiness in the day to day. </p>
                <p>What we had was beautiful, and afterall it all must end at some point, and there is beauty in that. Beauty in the leaves as I lay on my yoga mat on my patio, with a slight breeze, while the sun sits at its 2:00 PM spot gently casting rays on my body. There is beauty in the fact that I was able to feel something so intense towards another human being. There is beauty in being alive.</p>
